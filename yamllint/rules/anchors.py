Use this rule to prevent duplicated anchors
  and referencing to non-existent anchors.

.. rubric:: Options

* Use ``forbid-unknown-aliases`` to prevent referencing to anchors
  before assigment or referencing to non-existent anchors.
* Use ``forbid-duplicated-anchors`` to prevent duplicated anchors.


.. rubric:: Examples

#. With ``anchors: {forbid-duplicated-anchors: true}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    clients:
      jack: &jack_client
        billing_id: 1234
      bill: &bill_client
        billing_id: 5678
    target_client: *jack_client

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    clients:
      jack: &jack_client
        billing_id: 1234
      bill: &jack_client
        billing_id: 5678
    target_client: *jack_client

#. With ``anchors: {forbid-unknown-aliases: true}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    address: &address |
      Williams St. 13
